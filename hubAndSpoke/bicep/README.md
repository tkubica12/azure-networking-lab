# Deploy

```bash
az group create -n net -l centralus
az bicep build -f  .\hubAndSpoke\bicep\maintemplate.bicep
az deployment group create -g net --template-file .\hubAndSpoke\bicep\maintemplate.json
```

# Destroy

```bash
export keyvault=$(az deployment group show -n firewall -g net --query properties.outputs.keyVaultName.value -o tsv)
az keyvault delete -g net -n $keyvault 
az keyvault purge -n $keyvault 
az group delete -n net -y
```

# Demonstrations
# Tests after environment is deployed
Connect to jump server on its public ip.

## Test Private DNS
```bash
dig networking-demo-app1-vm.networking-demo.cz
```

## Check you can access app1 VM only via jump server (NSG)
```bash
ssh tomas@10.0.16.8 # should work
ssh tomas@10.0.1.4 # go to hub vm
    ssh tomas@10.0.16.8 # should fail
```

## Check app1 talks to outside of VNET via firewall
```bash
ssh tomas@10.0.16.8
    curl www.microsoft.com # allowed
    curl www.google.com # denied by Azure Firewall

# or connect to 3rd party appliance (10.0.3.4) and run tcpdump to check packets going throw

curl 10.0.32.4 # check access from app1 to web1

# Test threat intelligence
curl clicnews.com # Allowed from unprotected jump, denied from App1 behind Azure Firewall

# Traceroute via firewall
sudo apt update && sudo apt install traceroute -y && sudo traceroute -T 10.0.32.4
```

## Test load balancer
```bash
curl 10.0.32.4
curl 10.0.32.5
while true; do curl 10.0.32.100; done
```

## Check web farm is exposed via reverse proxy
Obtain reverse proxy public IP (IP of App Gateway or public IP of LB in front of 3rd party VMs)

## Test IaaS to PaaS secure connection via Private Link
Make sure you are not able to access your SQL server from jump server or your laptop over Internet. SQL server name is generated and it will be different in your case:

```bash
ssh tomas@10.0.16.8 # jump to app1
dig networking-demo-dbsrv-54pvmqd6pbm7c.database.windows.net  # Check private IP is returned
sqlcmd -S networking-demo-dbsrv-54pvmqd6pbm7c.database.windows.net -U tomas -P Azure12345678
```

## Check connection to onpremises resource
from jump server
ssh tomas@10.254.0.4

<!-- 
## Check PaaS (App Service) to VNET integration
Open globalwebregion1 WebApp and click on console
From PaaS check connectivity to VMs in VNET:
tcpping 10.0.0.4:22

## Check Azure Front Door
Get front door FQDN and test connectivity to WebApp

Try access with SQL injection attempt
https://networking-demo-globalniweb.azurefd.net/?%3D%27or%201%3D1

Access from jump server multiple times - no rate limit is applied.
```bash
curl https://networking-demo-globalniweb.azurefd.net
```

Access from PC in Czech Republic multiple times - you will be rate limited.

To test routing rules try put word "super" to URL. You will be redirected to Microsoft main page.
https://networking-demo-globalniweb.azurefd.net?super

Check global distribution - measure connection time from your PC, from jump server or other locations.

Via Front Door:
curl -w "Lookup: %{time_namelookup} \nConnect:%{time_connect} \n" http://networking-demo-globalniweb.azurefd.net --output /dev/null -s

Directly to WebApp in West Europe:
curl -w "Lookup: %{time_namelookup} \nConnect:%{time_connect} \n" https://networking-demo-globalwebregion1.azurewebsites.net --output /dev/null -s -->
